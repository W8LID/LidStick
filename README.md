# LidStick
A modified boom to reduce the weight of Arrow style handheld Yagi antennas.

The LidStick modified boom allows for weight reduction of ~30% allowing for greater comfort for the user.

A simple process of drilling the boom sidewalls and deburring by use of a countersink significantly reduces the overall weight of the assembled antenna.
